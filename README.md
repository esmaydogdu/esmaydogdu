I'm a software engineer doing web things, I craft user-friendly responsive interfaces using good old HTML+CSS+JS along with various frameworks and tools.

Based in Amsterdam, where I read, write and take photographs when I'm not coding.

### Currently

Building with JavaScript frameworks and design systems. Experimenting with vector databases, shaders, threeJS.

_With plenty of tree-staring for good measure_
